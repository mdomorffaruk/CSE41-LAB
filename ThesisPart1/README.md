# CSE4192-ThesisPart1 - Vulnerability Scanner

## Thesis Name: Vulnerability Scanner

### Overview

This repository is part of a final year thesis project focusing on developing a comprehensive Vulnerability Scanner. The goal is to create a robust web-based Software as a Service (SaaS) application that automates the scanning process for vulnerabilities in web applications.

### Functionalities

#### 1. Web Version (SaaS):

- **User Authentication:**
  - Secure user authentication for accessing the vulnerability scanning platform.
  - Role-based access control to manage different user roles.

- **Intuitive Dashboard:**
  - A user-friendly dashboard displaying scan results, statistics, and recent activities.

#### 2. Automated Scanning:

- **Wide Range of Vulnerabilities:**
  - Detection and reporting of various vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and more.

- **Scheduled Scans:**
  - Ability to schedule automated scans at specified intervals.
  - Email notifications for scan completion and critical findings.

- **Customizable Scans:**
  - Users can configure scan parameters and customize the scope of the scanning process.

#### 3. Reporting and Analysis:

- **Detailed Reports:**
  - Comprehensive reports with detailed information about identified vulnerabilities.
  - Suggestions and remediation steps for each vulnerability.

- **Historical Data Analysis:**
  - Historical data storage for trends analysis and tracking vulnerability management over time.

#### 4. Security and Compliance:

- **Compliance Checks:**
  - Integration with industry standards (OWASP, CWE) for compliance checks.
  - Automatic updates to keep compliance checks up-to-date.

- **Secure API:**
  - A secure API for programmatic access to scan results and integration with other security tools.

### How to Use

To use the Vulnerability Scanner, follow the steps mentioned in the previous README.md file.

Steps will be available later.

### Deployment

- Instructions on deploying the Vulnerability Scanner in different environments (development, staging, production).

Chat GPT

Hi GPT, need help making a project proposal, the proposal is about a vulnerability scanner. 
It will not scan any OS, it will scan websites [input will be website ip address or website address  ex: 10.0.0.1 or  www.abc.com ], and gives result of 
 port, host, dns, CVEs, etc scan result. It will show the result  in web interface. 

I will made backend with node js, front end with react. 
Nojs will run some bash script to get the result. 
Script will contain python , go and bash scripting. 

Project will be s SAAS (Software as a service, ) , Because I am planning to make it live+ make a subscription so that , all people can do normal scan, but some feature will be available only for subscription users.. 

as I am developing the project on my own, I have to make 3 things, 
1. project proposal
2. project presentation (pptx) so that I can show the project to teachers
3. Final project report. 
For now I only need the project proposal. I'll give you some content, maybe some another persons project as example so that you can understand about  it, then you have to make it for my project. 

response :

I want GPT to give me answer when I ask for answer.. No extra description, extra code, necessary, I actually not going to code now.. this is a project planning and proposal. so No code needed.
