# CSE4192-ThesisPart1 - Vulnerability Scanner

## Thesis Name: Vulnerability Scanner

### Overview

This repository is part of a final year thesis project focusing on developing a comprehensive Vulnerability Scanner. The goal is to create a robust web-based Software as a Service (SaaS) application that automates the scanning process for vulnerabilities in web applications.

### Functionalities

#### 1. Web Version (SaaS):

- **User Authentication:**
  - Secure user authentication for accessing the vulnerability scanning platform.
  - Role-based access control to manage different user roles.

- **Intuitive Dashboard:**
  - A user-friendly dashboard displaying scan results, statistics, and recent activities.

#### 2. Automated Scanning:

- **Wide Range of Vulnerabilities:**
  - Detection and reporting of various vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and more.

- **Scheduled Scans:**
  - Ability to schedule automated scans at specified intervals.
  - Email notifications for scan completion and critical findings.

- **Customizable Scans:**
  - Users can configure scan parameters and customize the scope of the scanning process.

#### 3. Reporting and Analysis:

- **Detailed Reports:**
  - Comprehensive reports with detailed information about identified vulnerabilities.
  - Suggestions and remediation steps for each vulnerability.

- **Historical Data Analysis:**
  - Historical data storage for trends analysis and tracking vulnerability management over time.

#### 4. Security and Compliance:

- **Compliance Checks:**
  - Integration with industry standards (OWASP, CWE) for compliance checks.
  - Automatic updates to keep compliance checks up-to-date.

- **Secure API:**
  - A secure API for programmatic access to scan results and integration with other security tools.
